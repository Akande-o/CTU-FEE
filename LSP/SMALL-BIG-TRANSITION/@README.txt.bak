*** Important Warning ***
************************************************************

The LCD display uses a Video Decoder chip on the board, so the circuit comes out simple.
Its pins have quite complex names, so aliases have been created.

!!! In demo, the project has already correct configuration, 
but if you create your own project, you must add the following files:

LCDgenerator, LCDRegDE2_115.vhd, LCDpackage, LCD_altpll.qip, lcd_display.sdc

Then, you need to import new pin assignments into empty pin list !!!

1/ Quartus menu: Assignments->Remove Assignments 
            + select * Pin, Location & Routing Assignments
		               * Fitter Assignments
			    Nothing else, and [Ok]
				 
2/ Assignments->Assignments Editor should show empty list, the requirement for importing aliases!
		      
3/ Quartus menu: Assignments->Import Assignments...
   and select DE2_115_lcd_pin_assignments.csv.
	Ignore error message that some part of the assignments has been ignored.
	
The file is identical with the original DE2_115_pin_assignments.csv, 
except for adding aliases at begining for several pins of the Video decoder.

+++ Do not also forget to add lcd_display.sdc by Assignments->Settings->TimeQuest Timing Analyzer
