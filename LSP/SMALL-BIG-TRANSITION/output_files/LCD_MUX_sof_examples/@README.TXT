Demo files
================
How to use:
-----------------------------------------------
1/ Start Quartus.
2/ In Quartus menu, select Tools->Programmer.
3/ In Programmer, perform first its hardware setup to USB-Blaster. 
4/ Then by [Add File...], select only 1 *.sof (sof=SRAM Object File).
5/ Load it to DE2-115 board by [Start]. 
6/ To see another *.sof, delete the first one *.sof from the programmer file list, 
   then repeat actions from item 4/
-----------------------------------------------------------
Note: Take all *.sof examples only as suggestions and design your better effects and movements. Let your imagination run wild.
*** If your VHDL code becomes too complex, you chose the wrong way. Reconsider it!
    All video switches, even the 30-point solution, have relatively simple VHDL codes.

----------------------------------------------------------------
* LCD_MUX_30points.sof
  The file demonstrates a solution for obtaining the maximum 30 points. 
  It contains the FSM that controls two different switching effects, plus the movements of the 320x240 city label and the timer. 
  We can set its wait time to 1 and 3 seconds by SW(0) 
  Hint: The movement coordinates of the 320x240 city label upper left corner are generated by additional FSM 
        that controls 2 up/down triangular counters. 
---------------------------------------------------------------
* LCD_MUX_30points_debug.sof 
  It is LCD_MUX_30points extended by suitable debug elements and by the possibility to freeze the image by SW(17):
    Debug:
    - 2 line LCD shows hint, created by lcd_text from DCE/LCD library as lcd_text;
    - HEX display shows logs of FSM states stored in a shift register. 
       Numbers are converted from integer to BCD (see lectures), followed by to7segment decoders from DCE/basic library.
    - Red LEDs indicate the waiting count by a bar indicator; the example of its possible code is on page 24 of 
        http://dcenet.felk.cvut.cz/edu/fpga/doc/CircuitDesignWithVHDL_dataflow_and_structural_eng_V10.pdf
    - Green LEDs display control signal received/sent by FSM;
      0 - Timer_Start - activate timer;
      1 - select wait time; 
      2 - Timer_Done - the timing was finished;
      3 - Effect RDY - start effect;
      4 - Effect Select - the selection of 1st or 2nd predefined effect; 
      5 - Effect ACK - the selected effect was finished;
      6 - Move_Start - begin moving of 320x24 flag;
      7 - Move Done -  the move reached the endpoint.
   
   - Cross-hatch was generated by the small code and fills unused area of the main LCD. 
   
 	   variable x8, y8 : integer range 0 to 7;
  	 type cross_t is array (0 to 7) of std_logic_vector(0 to 7);
	   constant CROSS : cross_t := ("00011000","00100100","01000010","10000001","10000001","01000010","00100100","00011000");
     
     -- after all color assignments, 2 new lines were inserted in DisplayLogic VHDL code:
 			x8 := to_integer(xcolumn(2 downto 0)); y8 := to_integer(yrow(2 downto 0)); -- modulo 8
			if (xcolumn>=XSCREEN or yrow>=YSCREEN) and CROSS(y8)(x8)='1' then  RGB:=ToRGB(63,63,63); end if;

     We let its minimizations to Quartus. It reduces its implementation only to 6 logical elements.

---------------------------------------------------------------
* LCD_MUX_20points_debug.sof 
  The file demonstrates the solution for obtaining 20 points. 
  It contains FSM that controls 2 different switching effects and a timer with 2 wait times, SW(0).
  In comparison with LCD_MUX_30points, there are no movements of 320x240 city label. 
---------------------------------------------------------------
* LCD_MUX_10points_debug.sof 
  The file demonstrates the solution for obtaining 10 points. 
  It contains FSM that controls only 1 switching effect and timer with two wait times, SW(0).
---------------------------------------------------------------
* LCD_MUX_5points_debug.sof 
  The file demonstrates the minimum solution for obtaining 5 points necessary for credits. 
  Two city labels are switched by 1 effect in a constant delay of 3 seconds.
  Compared with LCD_MUX_10points, there is no FSM, and its timer has a constant wait. 
  Thus, the effect can be easily created, e.g., by one up/down triangular counter and a proper comparison.
  Note: The teacher's architecture of the switching part has only 28 lines of VHDL code, including all definitions:-)
